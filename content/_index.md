# Hi, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! Check the links above to find out more.

## About me

I'm a Full-stack Software Engineer, working professionally for 7+ years.

My primary toolset is: C# .NET, Angular/React, and Azure. This is what I usually use for work, however for personal projects I use the best tool for the job, sometimes this is C#, othertimes it's Python or PHP. I'm always curious to learn new technologies, and I have a graveyard of abandoned projects to prove it!

When I'm not coding, you can find me chilling out with my 2 cats, reading books, watching and reviewing movies on Letterboxd, playing video games, cycling, at the gym, and sometimes bouncing on a trampoline (and trying not to land on my face!)

[Here's](https://mikepratt.dev) my old site, I made it using NextJS and Vercel.

## Contact

The best way to contact me is through Email. (I will put a link here soon, I'm not _that_ antisocial!)
