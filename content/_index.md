# Hi, I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! Check the links above to find out more.

## About me
I'm a Full-stack Software Engineer, working professionally for 7+ years.

My primary toolset is: C# .NET (not framework though!), Angular/React, and Azure. This is what I usually use for work, however for personal projects I use the best tool for the job, sometimes this is Python, othertimes it's Go or PHP. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading books, watching and reviewing movies on Letterboxd, playing video games, cycling, working out at the gym, and sometimes bouncing on a trampoline, trying not to land on my face!

[Here's](https://mikepratt.dev) my old site, I made it using NextJS and Vercel. The site you're on now was built using Hugo, which is much easier to manage!

## Contact
The best way to contact me is through Email. (I will put a link here at some point, I'm not *that* antisocial!)
